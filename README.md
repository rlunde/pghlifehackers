#### Stay Tuned for September 2018 Meeting: Travel Tips

We're still in the planning stages for the September meeting, but we'll have one or more experts in to talk about how you can:

- find deals and ways to have more fun for less money
- find places to go that are less crowded, more authentic, and more fun
- learn what to pack and what to leave at home
- find places to stay that are exactly what you want

#### Did you miss our August Meetup, Money Matters?

We had a fantastic meeting with 3 really interesting speakers. You can find
links and resources from our speakers [here](./resources/money_matters.md), including
a one-page PDF from Brent Sutherland on [Financial Planning for Financial Independence](./resources/Ntellivest_Presentation_Handout.pdf). I will add more links and notes
over the next few days.
