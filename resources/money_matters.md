# August 2018 Meeting: Money Matters

## Announcement

**Following are notes from the Meetup on**: Wednesday, August 29, 2018

Money is important to everyone, but many of us have a complex relationship with it. We'd love to have more of it, and we worry about it a lot, but somehow we still don't get around to learning some simple things we can do about it.

At the Life Hackers Meetup we heard some short talks by financial bloggers Meagan Taylor, Brynne Conroy, and Brent Sutherland.

Brent Sutherland spoke on achieving financial independence. Brent is a certified financial planner and has worked in financial services for over 12 years. Currently, he owns a personal financial consulting firm, Ntellivest, that works to help people think outside the box and better plan for financial independence. He is an early retirement advocate, real estate investor, semi-minimalist, and fried chicken enthusiast.

Meagan told us how she dug her own way out of debt in a very short period of time.

Having struggled with money through her early adult years, Meagan created Disney Mom at Home, which focuses on family finance and tips and tricks for travel, mainly to Disney. Since the majority of her followers are looking for tips and tricks on saving money and getting out of debt, she created FamilyFriendlyFinances.com, which is set to debut mid-August. Everyone has the power to overcome money problems, they just need realistic steps on how to do it!

In addition to blogging, Meagan runs a successful travel agency, Fairytale Journeys by Meagan, and is also a Senior Business Office Manager for a Long Term Care facility. She holds a BA in Journalism from Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
