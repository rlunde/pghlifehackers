### September 2018 Meeting: Travel Expert Tammy King Shares Her Tips for Travel

According to research, money spent on experiences is likely to result in happy memories that last a lifetime, while money spent on "stuff" is more likely to result in short-lived happiness that quickly fades.

Travel is (or can be) a great way to have unforgettable experiences.

But...

- How do you pick a place to visit?
- How do you spend less on things that don't matter as much?
- What do you bring?
- What do you do when you get there?
- How do you find places to eat with better food for less money?
- Where do you stay?
- How do you get around?
- What should you beware of?
- What do *you* want to know?

Come to the September Pittsburgh LifeHackers meetup for a great Q & A session with the best traveller I know. Tammy King knows many different languages and loves to spend all her spare time going places and doing things. She'll be there to talk about what she's learned about all these questions, and more -- bring your own questions to ask!

**Note**: Nobody will try to sell you *anything* at this meetup--I know some meetings like this have a reputation for being a thinly-disguised ruse to sell you a time share or something, but this is just a regular meetup meeting with none of that nonsense.

Everyone is welcome to join the conversation -- do you have a favorite spot to visit? Do you know a trick for saving money or finding good deals?

Or what about the reverse? Where should people NOT go? What are the worst things that ever happened to you on a trip? Maybe you can save someone else a lot of grief?

It'll be a fun chat, and may even inspire you to run off without your handkerchief and have an adventure. (Anyone know what that's a reference to?)

The meeting will be at 7pm on Tuesday, September 25, at Panera Bread on Centre avenue: 5430 Centre Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15232

The meeting room is in a back section of the restaurant that is behind the cashiers to the left, and then all the way at the back of that.

We're looking forward to a great discussion -- I hope you can make it!
