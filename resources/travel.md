### September 2018 Meeting: Happy Trails

According to psychologist and happiness expert Professor Daniel Gilbert , money spent on experiences is likely to result in happy memories that last a lifetime, while money spent on things is more likely to result in short-lived happiness that quickly fades.

Travel is (or can be) a great way to have unforgettable experiences.

There's no "one size fits all" vacation. Some people love camping in the remote wilderness, others love the night life of a metropolis. How do you design a trip that will make **you** happy, and that won't waste all your vacation time and money in some overpriced tourist trap?

Come find out...

- How do you pick the right place to visit? 
- How do you spend less on things that don't matter as much?
- What do you do when you get there?
- How do you find places to eat with better food for less money?
- Where do you stay?
- How do you get around?
- What do you bring?
- What should you beware of?

Come to the September Pittsburgh LifeHackers meetup for a great Q & A session with the best traveller I know. Tammy King knows many different languages and loves to spend all her spare time going places and doing things. She'll be there to talk about what she's learned about all these questions, and more -- bring your own questions to ask!

**Note**: This is just a free meeting full of great information. Nobody will try to sell you anything.

It'll be a fun chat, and may even inspire you to run off without your handkerchief and have an adventure.

The meeting will be 7:30pm--8:30pm on Tuesday, September 25, at Panera Bread on Centre avenue: 5430 Centre Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15232

This Panera is easy to reach and has free parking. The meeting room is in a back section of the restaurant that is behind the cashiers to the left.

We're looking forward to a great discussion -- I hope you can make it!
