## About Pittsburgh Life Hackers

Each month we discuss a specific topic related in some way to improving our lives, our jobs, or our community. We hope that you can make it to the meetup, but even if you can't you may find the resources related to each month's topic are interesting, useful, and fun!

Often we'll choose a book, a podcast, a video, and a blog that are related to the month's topic, and we'll discuss those at the meetup. Feel free to read/watch/listen to all, some, or none of them -- but show up anyway for the conversation!

Other times we'll invite guest speakers who are experts in the topic of the meeting.

Why "Life Hackers"? Before the word "hacker" was used to describe "a person who illegally gains access to and sometimes tampers with information in a computer system" it meant someone who enjoyed finding out about the details of things--what makes them work--and finding ways to get more out of it. The New Yorker has [a brief intro to the history of the word](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-short-history-of-hack)

The term "Life Hacker" means someone who enjoys figuring out the tips and tricks that make ordinary problems in life easier to solve. The show MacGyver was about a hacker in a similar way--he found creative solutions to any problem.

It's the intersection of knowledge and creativity.

We hope you join us!

### A Personal History of Pittsburgh Life Hackers

The Pittsburgh Life Hackers Meetup group was originally called the Pittsburgh Self-Improvement Meetup, and was running for years before I (Ron) ever joined. Unfortunately, after the first meetup I went to (I was the only one there besides the organizer at the time, Jack), I received a notice from Meetup.com that the group was shutting down unless someone else stepped up as organizer.

I was very disappointed. I'd moved to Pittsburgh a couple of years earlier, and thought
meetups might be a good way to meet interesting people. Since I'm writing a novel currently
that I call "a self-help thriller" I thought a self-improvement group might give me a chance to talk to people about what they thought was cool or interesting.

So I took over as organizer, hoping to eventually find one or two other people who might help with that.

- Conflicts of Interest: None

I'm not trying to sell anything to anyone. So far, I've paid all the fees for the meetup group myself (about $180 a year).
